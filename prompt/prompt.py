    "3. If more than 10 total steps have occurred in this session, immediately respond with final answer to prevent infinite recursion.\n"
    "4. Always use previous context and results to determine if the user's intent has been satisfied.\n"
    "5. As the user query, generate a response that summarizes the results. Don't generate any random anser.\n\n"
